# Data-Science-Analytics-Interns-Cycle-2
This repository contains four projects implemented in Python. Each project tackles a real-world problem using appropriate machine learning techniques, including classification, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
Projects Overview
Task 1: Employee Attrition Prediction
Objective: Predict whether an employee will leave the company using HR analytics data.
Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Dataset
Techniques Used:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Classification Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression
Explainable AI: SHAP & LIME
Outcome: A model that predicts employee attrition along with actionable HR retention strategies.
Task 2: Text Summarization
Objective: Build a summarization system for articles, blogs, and news.
Dataset: CNN/Daily Mail Dataset
Techniques Used:
Text Preprocessing
Extractive Summarization: Using spaCy
Abstractive Summarization: Using HuggingFace Transformers (BERT, GPT)
Model Fine-tuning and Evaluation
Outcome: A system that generates coherent and concise summaries from long textual data.
Task 3: Disease Diagnosis Prediction
Objective: Predict the likelihood of diseases like diabetes or heart disease using patient data.
Dataset: PIMA Diabetes Dataset / Heart Disease Dataset
Techniques Used:
EDA and Feature Selection
Scaling and Preprocessing
Models: Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks
Performance Evaluation: F1 Score, AUC-ROC
Outcome: A medical prediction model that assists healthcare professionals with early detection and prevention.
Task 4: Loan Default Prediction
Objective: Predict if a loan applicant will default based on financial data.
Dataset: Lending Club Loan Dataset
Techniques Used:
Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
Addressing Class Imbalance with SMOTE
Models: LightGBM, SVM
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Outcome: A classification model that helps lenders identify high-risk applicants, reducing financial defaults.
